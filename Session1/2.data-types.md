## Declaring a variable in Dart

dataType variableName = Initial Value

## Dynamic vs Var (Inference Type)

- Dynamic can override value to another has a different data type.
- Var create data type by the value that taken for the first time.

## Final vs Const

- final and const variables can only be set once.
- final variables may be set at either run time or compile time.
- const variables can only be set at compile time.

## Compile | Run time

- compile-time: get first when convert your code to binary
- run-time: get after when the code is excute

ex:
- a = 4 => value initialized at compile time
- b = a => get value at run time
- c = stdin.readLineSync() => at run time

## Get Type

- variable.runtimeType

# Null sefety

- if you want to say to compiler that is the variable can be contain null
    - int? num;
- if you want to say to compiler to stop showing error of variable can has a null
    - return num! + 5
